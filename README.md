# Clean-Imgui-Window
This header file works as an extension of ImGui namespace.
It provides integration of GLFW, GLEW, ImGui and custom procedures to create a clean independent GUI window quickly.


It began with the forging of the Great GUIs library. IMGui were given to the Open Source-Developers, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Qt to the Industry-Developers, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And .Net, .Net Framework were gifted to the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these library was bound the strength and the will to govern each application UI. But they were all of them deceived, for another header file was made. Deep in the land of CyberSpace, in the Fires of Visual Studio, the Dark Lord forged a master header file, and into this header he poured his openGL, his GLFW, GLEW and his will to extend ImGui.


One Header to rule them all, One Header to find them, One Header to bring them all and in the GUI bind them.
